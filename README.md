## Description

This is a stable version of the OASIS activity-based framework. This repository includes the simulation code, based on the Python API of the CPLEX solver.

For more details, you can find the technical reports in the **Literature** folder, and the full documentation [here](https://oasis-abm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation guide Â  

OASIS can be installed with the following command: 

``pip install oasisabm`` 

We recommend creating a new environment using the provided requirements file to install the correct packages. 
**NB: You need a valid CPLEX user license to use the solver, which can be obtained [here](https://www.ibm.com/academic/topic/data-science).**

**Note**: oasisabm does not support ARM-architecture

## Tutorial 

An example of how to run the simulator is provided in the ``demo`` notebooks. Your main function should be added in the ``runner`` script, which you can run by typing the following command:
``python runner.py``
